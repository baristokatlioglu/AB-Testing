## Business Problem : 
Facebook recently introduced a new type of bid, average bidding, as an alternative to the current type of bidding called maximum bidding.
One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding.

In this dataset, which includes the website information of bombabomba.com, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here.
There are two separate data sets, the control and test groups.

## Variables :
Impression – Ad views

Click – Click
Indicates the number of clicks on the displayed ad.

Purchase – purchase
Indicates the number of products purchased after the ads clicked.

Earning – Earning
Earnings after purchased products
